## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/javascript-countdown-timer.git
   ```

2. Include the `countdown-timer.js` file in your HTML:

   ```html
   <script src="path/to/countdown-timer.js"></script>
   ```

3. Add the necessary HTML markup to your page:

   ```html
   <div id="countdown"></div>
   ```

### Usage

1. Create a new instance of the CountdownTimer:

   ```javascript
   const countdownTimer = new CountdownTimer('countdown', {
     hours: 1,
     minutes: 30,
     seconds: 0,
     onTick: handleTick,
     onComplete: handleComplete
   });
   ```

2. Customize the countdown timer options as needed:

   - `hours` (optional): Number of hours for the countdown (default: 0).
   - `minutes` (optional): Number of minutes for the countdown (default: 0).
   - `seconds` (optional): Number of seconds for the countdown (default: 0).
   - `onTick` (optional): Callback function called on every tick of the timer.
   - `onComplete` (optional): Callback function called when the timer reaches zero.

3. Start the countdown timer:

   ```javascript
   countdownTimer.start();
   ```

### Styling

The countdown timer can be styled using CSS. The main container has the `countdown-timer` class, and each unit (hours, minutes, seconds) has its own class (`countdown-timer__hours`, `countdown-timer__minutes`, `countdown-timer__seconds`).

```css
.countdown-timer {
  /* Your styles here */
}

.countdown-timer__hours {
  /* Your styles here */
}

.countdown-timer__minutes {
  /* Your styles here */
}

.countdown-timer__seconds {
  /* Your styles here */
}
```
